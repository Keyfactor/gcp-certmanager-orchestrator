## Overview

The GCP Certificate Manager Orchestrator Extension remotely manages certificates on the Google Cloud Platform Certificate Manager Product.

This orchestrator extension implements three job types - Inventory, Management Add, and Management Remove. Below are the steps necessary to configure this Orchestrator Extension.  It supports adding certificates with private keys only.  The GCP Certificate Manager Orchestrator Extension supports the replacement of unbound certificates as well as certificates bound to existing map entries, but it does **not** support specifying map entry bindings when adding new certificates.



## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator version 10.4.1 and later.

## Support
The Google Cloud Provider Certificate Manager Universal Orchestrator extension is supported by Keyfactor for Keyfactor customers. If you have a support issue, please open a support ticket with your Keyfactor representative. If you have a support issue, please open a support ticket via the Keyfactor Support Portal at https://support.keyfactor.com. 
 
> To report a problem or suggest a new feature, use the **[Issues](../../issues)** tab. If you want to contribute actual bug fixes or proposed enhancements, use the **[Pull requests](../../pulls)** tab.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing the Google Cloud Provider Certificate Manager Universal Orchestrator extension, we recommend that you install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.


**Google Cloud Configuration**

1. Read up on [Google Certificate Manager](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs) and how it works.

2. Either a Google Service Account is needed with the following permissions (Note: Workload Identity Management Should be used but at the time of the writing it was not available in the .net library yet), or the virtual machine running the Keyfactor Orchestrator Service must reside within Google Cloud.
![](docsource/images/ServiceAccountSettings.gif)

3. The following Api Access is needed:
![](docsource/images/ApiAccessNeeded.gif)

4. If authenticating via service account, download the Json Credential file as shown below:
![](docsource/images/GoogleKeyJsonDownload.gif)


## Create the GcpCertMgr Certificate Store Type

To use the Google Cloud Provider Certificate Manager Universal Orchestrator extension, you **must** create the GcpCertMgr Certificate Store Type. This only needs to happen _once_ per Keyfactor Command instance.



* **Create GcpCertMgr using kfutil**:

    ```shell
    # GCP Certificate Manager
    kfutil store-types create GcpCertMgr
    ```

* **Create GcpCertMgr manually in the Command UI**:
    <details><summary>Create GcpCertMgr manually in the Command UI</summary>

    Create a store type called `GcpCertMgr` with the attributes in the tables below:

    #### Basic Tab
    | Attribute | Value | Description |
    | --------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Name | GCP Certificate Manager | Display name for the store type (may be customized) |
    | Short Name | GcpCertMgr | Short display name for the store type |
    | Capability | GcpCertMgr | Store type name orchestrator will register with. Check the box to allow entry of value |
    | Supports Add | âœ… Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Add |
    | Supports Remove | âœ… Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Remove |
    | Supports Discovery | âœ… Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Discovery |
    | Supports Reenrollment | ðŸ”² Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Reenrollment |
    | Supports Create | âœ… Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports store creation |
    | Needs Server | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if a target server name is required when creating store |
    | Blueprint Allowed | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if store type may be included in an Orchestrator blueprint |
    | Uses PowerShell | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if underlying implementation is PowerShell |
    | Requires Store Password | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Enables users to optionally specify a store password when defining a Certificate Store. |
    | Supports Entry Password | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a password. |

    The Basic tab should look like this:

    ![GcpCertMgr Basic Tab](docsource/images/GcpCertMgr-basic-store-type-dialog.png)

    #### Advanced Tab
    | Attribute | Value | Description |
    | --------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Supports Custom Alias | Required | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a custom Alias. |
    | Private Key Handling | Required | This determines if Keyfactor can send the private key associated with a certificate to the store. Required because IIS certificates without private keys would be invalid. |
    | PFX Password Style | Default | 'Default' - PFX password is randomly generated, 'Custom' - PFX password may be specified when the enrollment job is created (Requires the Allow Custom Password application setting to be enabled.) |

    The Advanced tab should look like this:

    ![GcpCertMgr Advanced Tab](docsource/images/GcpCertMgr-advanced-store-type-dialog.png)

    #### Custom Fields Tab
    Custom fields operate at the certificate store level and are used to control how the orchestrator connects to the remote target server containing the certificate store to be managed. The following custom fields should be added to the store type:

    | Name | Display Name | Description | Type | Default Value/Options | Required |
    | ---- | ------------ | ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
    | Location | Location | **global** is the default but could be another region based on the project. | String | global | âœ… Checked |
    | ServiceAccountKey | Service Account Key File Path | The file name of the Google Cloud Service Account Key File installed in the same folder as the orchestrator extension. Empty if the orchestrator server resides in GCP and you are not using a service account key. | String |  | ðŸ”² Unchecked |

    The Custom Fields tab should look like this:

## Installation

1. **Download the latest Google Cloud Provider Certificate Manager Universal Orchestrator extension from GitHub.** 

    Navigate to the [Google Cloud Provider Certificate Manager Universal Orchestrator extension GitHub version page](https://github.com/Keyfactor/gcp-certmanager-orchestrator/releases/latest). Refer to the compatibility matrix below to determine whether the `net6.0` or `net8.0` asset should be downloaded. Then, click the corresponding asset to download the zip archive.
    | Universal Orchestrator Version | Latest .NET version installed on the Universal Orchestrator server | `rollForward` condition in `Orchestrator.runtimeconfig.json` | `gcp-certmanager-orchestrator` .NET version to download |
    | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Older than `11.0.0` | | | `net6.0` |
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net6.0` | | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `Disable` | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `LatestMajor` | `net8.0` | 
    | `11.6` _and_ newer | `net8.0` | | `net8.0` |

    Unzip the archive containing extension assemblies to a known location.

    > **Note** If you don't see an asset with a corresponding .NET version, you should always assume that it was compiled for `net6.0`.

2. **Locate the Universal Orchestrator extensions directory.**

    * **Default on Windows** - `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Orchestrator\extensions`
    * **Default on Linux** - `/opt/keyfactor/orchestrator/extensions`
    
3. **Create a new directory for the Google Cloud Provider Certificate Manager Universal Orchestrator extension inside the extensions directory.**
        
    Create a new directory called `gcp-certmanager-orchestrator`.
    > The directory name does not need to match any names used elsewhere; it just has to be unique within the extensions directory.

4. **Copy the contents of the downloaded and unzipped assemblies from __step 2__ to the `gcp-certmanager-orchestrator` directory.**

5. **Restart the Universal Orchestrator service.**

    Refer to [Starting/Restarting the Universal Orchestrator service](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/StarttheService.htm).


6. **(optional) PAM Integration** 

    The Google Cloud Provider Certificate Manager Universal Orchestrator extension is compatible with all supported Keyfactor PAM extensions to resolve PAM-eligible secrets. PAM extensions running on Universal Orchestrators enable secure retrieval of secrets from a connected PAM provider.

    To configure a PAM provider, [reference the Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) to select an extension, and follow the associated instructions to install it on the Universal Orchestrator (remote).


> The above installation steps can be supplimented by the [official Command documentation](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/CustomExtensions.htm?Highlight=extensions).
