## Overview

The Google Cloud Provider (GCP) Certificate Manager Universal Orchestrator extension remotely manages certificates on the Google Cloud Platform Certificate Manager product. This extension facilitates three job types: Inventory, Management Add, and Management Remove. It supports adding certificates with private keys only.

In the context of the GCP Certificate Manager, certificates are used to secure communications and authenticate identities for various services and applications. The GCP Certificate Manager simplifies the process of provisioning, managing, and deploying SSL/TLS certificates.

Defined Certificate Stores of the Certificate Store Type represent a logical grouping or container of certificates that reside on the remote platform, in this case, the Google Cloud Platform. These Certificate Stores can include unbound certificates as well as certificates bound to existing map entries, enabling streamlined management of your certificates in the cloud environment.
